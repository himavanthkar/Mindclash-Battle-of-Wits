# MindClash GROQ Integration Troubleshooting Guide

This guide provides steps to troubleshoot and verify that the GROQ AI integration is working correctly in your MindClash application.

## Starting the Servers

### Django Backend
1. Open a terminal 
2. Navigate to the backend directory:
   ```
   cd C:\D drive\Courses\Django\MindClash\backend
   ```
3. Run the server:
   ```
   python manage.py runserver
   ```
4. You should see output indicating the server is running at http://127.0.0.1:8000/

### React Frontend
1. Open a new terminal
2. Navigate to the frontend directory:
   ```
   cd C:\D drive\Courses\Django\MindClash\frontend
   ```
3. Run the development server:
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```
4. You should see output indicating the server is running, typically at http://localhost:5173/

## Testing GROQ API Connection

To verify the GROQ AI connection is working:

1. With both servers running, open your browser and go to:
   ```
   http://localhost:5173/test-groq
   ```
2. Click the "Test GROQ Connection" button
3. If working correctly, you should see a response showing "hello" in different languages
4. If there's an error, check the error message and troubleshoot accordingly

## Common Issues and Solutions

### GROQ API Key Issues
1. Verify the API key in `backend/backend/settings.py`
2. Check for any spaces or special characters that might have been incorrectly copied

### CORS Issues
1. Ensure the frontend URL (http://localhost:5173) is in the CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS list in Django settings
2. Check browser console for CORS-related errors

### Connection Issues
1. Verify both servers are running
2. Check that the frontend is making requests to the correct backend URL (http://localhost:8000)
3. Check browser console for any network errors

### Package Installation Issues
1. In the frontend directory, ensure axios is installed:
   ```
   npm install axios
   ```
2. In the backend directory, ensure groq package is installed:
   ```
   pip install groq
   ```

## Testing the Quiz Generator

1. Navigate to http://localhost:5173/ai-quiz
2. Fill in a topic (e.g., "JavaScript Basics"), number of questions, and difficulty
3. Click "Generate Quiz"
4. You should see the quiz questions generated by GROQ

If you encounter any issues with the quiz generator, try using the simpler /test-groq endpoint first to verify the GROQ API connection is working at a basic level.
